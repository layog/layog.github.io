            <h2>About this blog</h2>
            <p>Hey stranger!</p>
            <p>My name is Ankit Goyal and I am planning to blog about computer
            science and engineering here. My interests span a vast range of
            topics in CS/engineering domain including compilers, OS, competitive
            programming, parallel algorithms, robotics etc. In terms of
            programming languages, most of my experience is in Python, C++,
            followed closely by C. I am planning to pick up Rust and some
            functional programming language next.</p>
            <p>Work wise I currently work in Taipei with Google where my
            work revolves around Pixel graphics pipeline. In the past, I have
            worked with <a href="https://hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> as a TCE
            (Technical Content Engineer) and later on as SDE (Software
            Development Engineer). I do not work actively on web development
            anymore but still very much interested in learning about scalable
            systems.</p>
            <p>If you find some error in any of the articles, the best way is to
            <a href="https://github.com/layog/layog.github.io/issues/new">open
                an issue on Github</a> or email me at the below listed address.
            Email is open for other purposes as well, in case you want to share your
            thoughts about this blog or anything else.</p>
