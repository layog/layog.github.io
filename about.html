            <h2>About this blog</h2>
            <p>My name is Ankit Goyal and I am planning to blog about computer
            science and engineering in general. My interests span a vast range
            of topics in CS domain including compilers, OS, competitive
            programming, parallel algorithms, robotics etc. Previously, I have
            blogged a bit on <a href="https://medium.com/@layog">Medium</a> about
            Machine Learning and related topics. In terms of languages, most of
            my experience is in Python, C++, followed closely by C. I have also
            worked with Ruby, JS and a bit with Go and C#. I am planning to pick
            up Rust and some functional programming language next.</p>
            <p>Work wise, I am currently employed by Google Taiwan where my work
            revolves around Pixel graphics pipeline. In the past, I have worked
            with <a href="https://hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a> as a TCE
            (Technical Content Engineer) and later on as SDE (Software
            Development Engineer). I do not actively work on web development
            anymore but still very much interested in learning about scalable
            systems.</p>
            <p>If you find some error in any of the articles, the best way is to
